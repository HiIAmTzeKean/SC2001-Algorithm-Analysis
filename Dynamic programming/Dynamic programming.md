# Dynamic programming

Similar to [[Divide and conquer]].
Problems are divided into overlapping subproblems and each are solved recursively â†’ DP approach is to not compute the same subproblem more than once.

Pure [[Divide and conquer|D&C]] solution can have repeated computation which may lead to exponential complexity. [[Dynamic programming|DP]] memorize the solution solutions, allowing algorithm to check if subproblem is solved, and if it is solved, return the solution, else algorithm will solve it.

## 2 types of strategy
1. [[Top down approach]]
2. [[Bottom up approach]]
