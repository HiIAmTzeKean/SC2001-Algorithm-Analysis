# Top down approach

Solution to solve top-down should use a tree diagram to illustrate the recurrence call to smaller subproblems

- Break a large problem into subproblems
- Solutions are memorized in dictionaries
- Check if subproblems solved before
    - If solved before, get the memorized solution
    - Else make recursive call to solve the subproblem and memorize the solution
- Store solution to large problem using memorized subproblems
- Return solution
