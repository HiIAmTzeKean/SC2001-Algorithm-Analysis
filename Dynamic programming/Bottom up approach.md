# Bottom up approach

Solution of the subproblems can be viewed as a directed graph. The directed edged from a vertex of larger number to smaller number will denote dependency â†’ strategize the right order to solve the subproblems.

- Problem is formulated from smaller subproblems to larger subproblems
- Subproblem graph can be created
    - The graph will denote dependency and dimension of the problem
    - If the graph does not have a linear solution, then there could be higher dimension
    - The number of [[Parameter]] can be good indicator of dimension
- Dictionary is used to memorize the solution
