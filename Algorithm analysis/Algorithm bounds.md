# Algorithm bounds

## Big-oh notation
- We are looking for some constant for a function $f(n)$ such that $f(n) <= c * g(n),\text{for all } n>n_0$ where *c* is a constant and $n_0$ is some constant
- Note that $n_0$ need not be unique, we just need to show some property of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ when n tends to infinity
- $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$
